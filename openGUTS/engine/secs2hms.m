%SECS2HMS - converts a time in seconds to a string giving the time in hours, minutes and second
%Usage TIMESTRING = SECS2HMS(TIME)]);
%Example 1: >> secs2hms(7261)
%>> ans = 2 hours, 1 min, 1.0 sec
%Example 2: >> tic; pause(61); disp(['program took ' secs2hms(toc)]);
%>> program took 1 min, 1.0 secs
